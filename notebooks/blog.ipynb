    "## The canvas\n",
    "\n",
    "A drawable surface is the most basic requirement for any game development. In the web world, this is usually provided by the HTML5 `<canvas>` element.\n",
    "In Jupyter, there are several ways to create and manipulate a canvas. The most popular one is the `ipycanvas` package, which provides a high-level API for creating and manipulating canvases in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "However, `ipycanvas` is tied to the jupyter protocol, which makes it difficult to create a smooth gaming experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The jupyter protocol is a fire and forget protocol. Once a cell is executed, the kernel sends the output to the frontend and forgets about it.\n",
    "This works well for data science and machine learning, where the output is usually a static image or text.\n",
    "However, for game development, we need a way to continuously update the output at a fixed frame rate (e.g., 60 frames per second). \n",
    "While `ipycanvas` provides a way to update the canvas, it is impossible with ipycanvas to know when the frontend has actually rendered the updated canvas. This can lead to situations where the kernel is sending updates faster than the frontend can render them, leading to a choppy and unresponsive gaming experience.\n"

    "## The OffscreenCanvas \n",
    "\n",
    "The HTML5 OffscreenCanvas API provides a way to create a canvas that can be rendered offscreen, i.e., without being attached to the DOM. This allows us to create a canvas in the frontend / main-ui thread, and then transfer it to a web worker for rendering. \n",
    "Using the OffscreenCanvas API, we can create a custom canvas widget that creates an OffscreenCanvas in the frontend, transfers it to the kernel running in a web worker, and then uses it for rendering.\n",
    "Since kernels like xeus-python provide a Javascript foreign function interface, we can directly call Javascript functions from Python , and use them to directely call the OffscreenCanvas API. Hence we can create a smooth gaming experience and render to the canvas at a fixed frame rate. That way, it is impossible to send updates faster than the frontend can render them, since the calls to the OffscreenCanvas API are blocking until the rendering is done.\n",
    "That way we can bypass the limitations of the jupyter protocol and create a smooth gaming experience in JupyterLite.\n",
    "\n",
